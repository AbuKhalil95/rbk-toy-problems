/*
 * Given an array of numbers, calculate the greatest continuous sum of numbers in it. 
 * Continuous sum means sum of numbers that are next to each other
 * A single array item will count as a contiguous sum.
 * Example: 
 * var arr = [1,2,3,-3,2];
 * sumArray(arr);//should return 6 because the greatest continuous sum is 1+2+3. If we include -3 and 2, the sum will be smaller.
