### React

Create a fish pond in React:

* [X] Install `live-server` if you haven't yet: `npm install -g live-server`
* [X] Start the app by running `live-server` from the root of this directory
* [X] Inside `app.js`, render the `FishTable` component to the `div` with `id="app"`
* [X] Refactor the `FishTable` component to display the data inside of `fishData` instead of the currently used hardcoded data
* [X] If it doesn't already, refactor `FishTable` to render exactly one `FishTableRow` for each fish object inside of `fishData`
